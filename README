= Welcome!

Kwiki-Kwiki is the /easy/ way to make your own the Kwiki-based wiki software.

If you are reading this, you probably have everything you need to get going.

Well you'll also need these things:

1) An internet connection.
2) A Subversion client. aka the "svn" command line tool.
3) A CGI capable web server setup.
4) A couple minutes to run the install script.

Ready?

Just type:

    perl bin/install

from the command line and answer the questions.

Enjoy!
